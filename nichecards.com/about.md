That would be me, Frank Mitchell. I'm a recovering introvert. I like helping
people with their personal problems. I give tear inducing speeches at weddings.
I [dance when no one is watching][1] and sometimes [when people are][2]. I geek
out on typography.

## And what the heck are niche cards? ##

Pasteboard products with personalities. Unique [decks of cards][3] for
microscopically small markets. Little packages of creativity incubation that
fit in your luggage without TSA getting suspicious.
