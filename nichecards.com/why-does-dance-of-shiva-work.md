When I started doing Dance of Shiva, I was okay with the [wave your arms, get
epiphanies][1] thing. I'd had enough experience with physical therapy to know
that changes in the body could cause changes in the brain. That satisfaction
lasted about 16 minutes, and then the engineer in me demanded to know where the
epiphanies where coming from.

  But in the Dance of Shiva, the main accent is made on the development of the
  multi-sector control of the bodyâ€™s controlling structures, the increases of
  the speed of the controlling processes, and the forms of the new algorithms
  of transcendental links in the consciousness. These new links increase the
  power and generation of the bio-processor.

While I love the modern day alchemist tone of [Andrey's writing][2], it wasn't
the lucid explanation I wanted. So I started reading about neuroscience.

### It's a whole brain thing. ###

In his book [A Whole New Mind][3], Daniel Pink points out that because we in the
Western part of the world read left to right and are predominately right handed,
we suffer from what is called "an alphabetic mind". The left hemisphere of our
brain controls the right side of our body, thinks sequentially, understands
text, and knows how to analyze details. People who are L-Directed Thinkers,
statisticians, engineers, accountants, love it over there.

On the other side, the right hemisphere controls the left side of the body,
thinks simultaneously, specializes in context, and knows how to synthesize the
big picture. People who are R-Directed Thinkers, actors, musicians, poets, like
the right side more. And as Seth Godin points out in [Linchpin][4], we need more
and more creative thinkers since we're giving the non-creative jobs away to
robots.

The lovely thing about Dance of Shiva is that it works on both sides of the
brain. The simultaneous movement of both arms means the left and right
hemispheres are working together to coordinate the spiral motions. The left
hemisphere will interpret the number of a particular position while the right
hemisphere puts it into the context of the level being worked on. L-Directed
Thinkers will be exercising the right hemispheres of their brains more than
they're used to, and visa versa for R-Directed Thinkers. That's where the
epiphanies come from.

### Eventually, the monkey mind gets exhausted. ###

Because Dance of Shiva challenges the whole brain, it's an extremely mental
workout. If you're making it challenging, you eventually reach the point where
you're saying the numbers wrong, your failing spastically, and your conscious
mind is totally exhausted. In the gap of silence that happens when you lay down
for _shavasana_ afterwards, your subconscious has a chance to talk.

The creative sparkles and new insights that come after practicing Dance of Shiva
happen because your brain has made new neurological connections. In her
research, Elizabeth Gould showed that [rich, stimulating environments cause
neurogenesis and increased dendrite density][5]. Because Dance of Shiva actively
fires neurons on both sides of your brain, it causes new connections to form
between your brain cells.

Those new synaptic patterns and connections mean you think about things in new
ways, drawing connections and making conclusions you haven't seen before.
