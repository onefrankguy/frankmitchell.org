**Why Don't I Know?**

I don't know why the caged bird sings.  
I don't know who the lord of the flies is.  
I don't know where Waldo's at.  

Was my childhood not long enough?  

I don't know how to eat fried worms.  
I don't know what the view from the cherry tree looks like.  
I don't know when the wrinkle in time is.  

Did my summers pass too fast?  

I don't know how the handmaid's tale goes.  
I don't know what makes bumps in the night.  
I don't know how the light in the attic got left on.  

Why don't I know what I don't know?  

## Background ##
