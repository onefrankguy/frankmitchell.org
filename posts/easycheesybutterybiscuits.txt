### Background ###

This recipe comes from _Horizon Organic_, and I've got no experience with it.

### Ingredients ###

* 2 cups all purpose flour
* 4 teaspoons baking powder
* 0.5 teaspoons salt
* 0.5 cups (1 stick) butter
* 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
* 0.5 cups milk
* 2 tablespoons dried onion flakes (optional)

### Preparation ###

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. If you're using onion flakes, soak them in the milk. Stir all the dry ingredients together. Using two forks, cut butter into dry ingredients until it resembles cornmeal. Mix the cheese and milk and blend everything until it's slightly sticky. Drop large spoonfuls on a greased cookie sheet and bake 10 to 15 minutes.
