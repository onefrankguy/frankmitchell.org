John Maeda makes an interesting [comment][] about quoting people:

> "When there are sufficient and relevant comments from readers, I have decided to post them in this format from time to time. Figuring out the timing will be a work in progress. All URL's for people that I mention are Google-able, but not linked in this blog as I prefer having less, instead of more, links."

The researcher in me wants attribution if it's available. However, in the context of both [Maeda's site][] and mine, where comments can occur via email, attribution is sometimes impossible. If a reader doesn't have a web presence, it's hard to link to them. Providing enough information so that their [Google-able][] is a nice compromise.

But more interesting than that, is the idea of _less_ links. It defiantly simplifies things, and I'm guessing that it will encourage a few readers to [learn to search][] as well, but does it go against the grain of the web? Isn't the web all about hyperlinks and connections between related bits of information? Or is that model changing?

We're moving towards less static links and more dynamic ones. Thanks to tags, search engines, and filters, information is now connected on-the-fly. I'm thinking that auto-linking, where related information is automatically discovered and linked to, is just around the corner.

All the pieces are there. We just need the connections that pull them together.
