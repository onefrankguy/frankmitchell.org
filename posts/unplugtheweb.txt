The guys over at [Morfik][] got it right. I want to use [GMail][], but I want all my information to be there when I'm not online too. I want to be able to print a hard copy of my address book and stick it in the back of my Moleskine. I want paper convenience in a digital world. I want my applications to work with and without the internet.

And it want it all to fit on a USB key, so I can stick it in my pocket, and have my digital life (with all its preferences and settings just the way I left them) usable when ever and where ever I am.
