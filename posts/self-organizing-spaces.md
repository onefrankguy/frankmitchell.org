> "A combination of the distortion viewing principle with the space memory
> principle. The space reacts immediately to the shift of attention but also has
> long-term memory of the accumulated actions. Through this layering of
> properties the directness of access to all parts of the space is obtained as
> well as the shaping of the space through the actions of all users interacting
> with it. The purpose of this is to be able to scale up the number of elements
> and users without reducing the visual clarity of the display since the other
> user are experienced as mediating the changes in the space. The changes in the
> space cause a clustering or dispersion of the elements in certain areas
> creating various foci of attention. These clusters can be viewed as areas of
> higher activity where more information flows in order to get exposure to
> attention."
