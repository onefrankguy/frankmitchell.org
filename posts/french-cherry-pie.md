### Background ###

This is my mother's recipe for cherry pie.

### Ingredients ###

* 9 inch graham cracker pie crust
* 8 ounces cream cheese
* 0.5 cups powdered sugar
* 0.5 teaspoons almond flavor
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 1.5 cups whipped cream
* 1 can cherry pie filling

### Preparation ###

Cream the cheese, sugar, vanilla, and almond flavor together. Fold into the whipped cream. Spread concoction in the pie crust. Let it stand a few minutes, than spread the cherry pie filling on top. Refrigerate several hours (or overnight), and in the meantime, eat the remaining pie filling.
