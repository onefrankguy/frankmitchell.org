fuzzy yellow caterpillar words  
tumble down green leaf pages  
groping desperately for the  
meaning of brown twig lines  
only to land in messy heaps of  
fluff and black letter legs at the  
bottom.  

simile antennae wiggle furiously as  
nouns disentangle themselves from  
the wreckage of their verbal siblings  
then strut around the margin root  
arguing about who will show up  
first.  

proud caterpillar words!  

they want so much to please to  
climb the brown twig lines and  
dance upon the green leaf pages  
to wave their black letter legs at  
the reader and show their simile  
antennae.  

hide  
hide little caterpillar words  
hide inside cocoon meanings  
don't wave your letter legs  
don't show your simile antennae  
hide  
hide that you might find  
inside yourselves  
the metaphors of  
butterflies.
