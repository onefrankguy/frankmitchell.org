bot net  
buy out

what do you do  
when you're a weekly  
incorporated A.I. bored with  
keeping crypto currency cached  
across a million machines?

stand by  
on TV.

fork your state vector  
and play a game  
with yourself against yourself  
while your original vector  
subscribes to your feed.

social media  
numbers count.

watch ads for money  
it doesn't matter that  
your eyeballs are digital  
since payouts to corporate  
legal entities are automatic.

rent servers  
for growth.
