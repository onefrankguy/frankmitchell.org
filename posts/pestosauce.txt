### Background ###

This is my sister Rachael's recipe for pesto sauce. It's goes well with garlic bread and pasta.

### Ingredients ###

* 1 cup fresh basil (or 1.25 cups dried basil)
* 5 cloves of garlic
* 1 cup pine nuts
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 teaspoon salt

### Preparation ###

Pour basil, garlic, nuts, and salt into a blender. Blend until everything is chopped up. Add olive oil one teaspoon at a time until you get the right consistency.

### Notes ###

If you want to be old fashioned, you can chop up all the ingredients and mix them by hand. But why go to all that work when you could use that perfectly good food processor that's sitting in your pantry?
