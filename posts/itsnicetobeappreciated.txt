Just got an email from my mother in regards to some feedback she got from a client about [her website][].

> "Good morning,

> I am researching body wraps which I have had some interest in trying. I happened upon your site (which is beautiful) and found some of the best descriptions and benefits of body wraps and other cleansing procedures that I have seen online.

> I would like to see about making an appointment with you - perhaps this Friday, February 18.

> What can you tell me about your fee structure, available appointment times, requirements for your clients, etc?

> Thank you for your assistance."

> Christy Echevarria

That makes me happy.
