### Background ###

From the _Mitchell Family Cookbook_, this is my grandmother's recipe for potato salad.

### Ingredients ###

* potatoes
* chopped celery
* grated onions
* sliced black olives
* pimentos
* little mustard
* little mayonnaise
* dash of salt
* dash of pepper
* splash of pickle juice

### Preparation ###

Boil potatoes, peel, and cube. Add all the other ingredients and mix well. Serve cold.

### Notes ###

Potato salad really doesn't have measurements for anything. It's a "too taste" sort of food.
