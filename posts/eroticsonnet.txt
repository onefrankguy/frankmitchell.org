So much heat. Lines traced by oily fingers  
That arch my body, making me beg. Water.  
No. Spoken softly but the word lingers.  
Held in place by hair ribbons grown tauter.

Didn't know one pepper could get hotter  
Than it's initial bite. Her kisses burn.  
Carress my skin. Find me again, in her.
