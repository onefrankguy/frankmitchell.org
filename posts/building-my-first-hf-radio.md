I missed out on the [Heathkit][] heyday, those times in the 1960s and 70s when
building your own HF radio was the defacto way to get on the air. So when
I upgraded to a General class amateur license in January, I decided I wanted to
build my own radio.

Part of my motivaion was to really understand how a radio works, instead of
just turning knobs and pushing buttons on an applicance. Originally, I planned
to follow the suggestions in Doug Hendricks's ["So You Want To Be A Builder,
Huh?"][builder] course and follow along with [Elmer 101][] to build a
[SW-40+][].  But I missed out on the chance to pick one up before [Small Wonder
Labs][] went out of business.

I thought about getting a [Cyclone 40][] from the [Four State QRP Club][], but
asside from [the Yahoo discussion group][yahoo], there's not much documentation
on how that particular radio works. The [K1][] from [Elecraft][] got some
consideration, since it's got great documentation, but the $300 USD price tag
was a bit out of my budget.

When I heard Bob Dyer was stopping production on [Wilderness Radio][] kits, I
decided I didn't want to miss out. So I picked up a NorCal 40A, complete with
all the bells and whistles e.g. a [KC1 Frequency Counter][] and [BuzzNot Noise
Blanker][]. As it turns out, another perk of the NorCal 40A is that there's a
book about it! [The Electronics of Radio][] walks you through construction
step by step, explaining how and why each circuit works.

Inspired by [Dave Richards's photography][aa7ee], I'm going to document my build
of the NorCal 40A. To kick things off, here's an overview of the bare circuit
board sitting in the lower half of its case.

The case itself is about four and a half inches by four and a half inches.
With ??? inches of clearance between the bottom of the case and the
board, and a top case that mirrors the bottom one, there's plenty of room for
expansions, add-ons, and experiments.
