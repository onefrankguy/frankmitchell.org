### Said it before, but... ###

I love [Modwest][]!

Eighteen emails after the fact, Allen Lee of Modwest tech support, has finally helped me resolve my mod\_rewrite rules. Thanks to his hard work, pretty URLs should work without a glitch now, and I know a thing or two more about mod_rewrite than when this started.

Plus, because the people at Modwest hate spam as much as I do, comment emails are automagically filtered with [SpamAssassin][]. Yay for technologically literate hosting companies that care about their customers.
