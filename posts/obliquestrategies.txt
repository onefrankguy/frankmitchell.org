Taken from [the deck][] by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt:

#### Oblique Strategies ####

[blank white card]  
Accept advice  
Be dirty  
Change nothing and continue with immaculate consistency  
Do we need holes?  
Emphasize repetitions  
Faced with a choice, do both  
Go outside. Shut the door.  
How would you have done it?  
Infinitesimal gradations  
Just carry on  
Lowest common denominator  
Mute and continue  
Not building a wall but making a brick  
(Organic) machinery  
Put a blank in an exquisite frame; make it valuable  
Remove ambiguities and convert to specifics  
Spectrum analysis  
Towards the insignificant  
Use filters  
What are you really thinking about just now?  
You are an engineer

### Notes ###

My eventual goal is one from every letter of the alphabet (taking artistic license as needed; see 'p'). That makes this an abecdearian, which is a type of [acrostic][] poetry. 

Still missing, 'k', 'q', 'v', 'x', and 'z'.

I like the idea of creating poetry out of something as non-poetic as business strategies. Though given the creative threads that run between art and design, it's really not that oblique a stretch.
