My personal definiton of done is that you can use it now, and you won't ask me
questions about it for at least a week.

For client projeccts, this means that the interface is intuitive enough to be
self expanatory (a rare case) or that documentation is included with the
product. For server side pieces, it means backup and deployment solutions
are in place so I swifty fix things should something break. In both cases, it
means I've done enough personal QA and stress testing to know that what I'm
handing you is a robust piece of engineering.
