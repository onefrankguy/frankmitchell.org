### Background ###

My grandmother's recipe for meatloaf as it appears in the _Mitchell Family Cookbook_.

### Ingredients ###

* 1 8 ounce can of tomato soup
* 0.5 cups of ketchup
* 1 pound ground beef
* 7 ounces of whole chilies
* 2 eggs
* 1 cup bread crumbs
* 8 ounces grated cheese

### Preparation ###

Mix tomato soup and ketchup, then set aside. Mix the meat, eggs, crumbs, and half the tomato mixture. Stuff 6 whole chilies with half of the grated cheese. Cut the remaining chilies into strips. In a well greased 5 by 10 by 3 loaf pan, pour half the remaining tomato mixture, then spread in half the meat mixture. Lay the stuffed chilies on top and cover with the remaining meat. Pour the remaining tomato mixture over the top and garnish with chili strips and cheese. Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour. Let set 5 minutes before serving.
