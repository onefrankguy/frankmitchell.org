### For Any Kid Who's Ever Loved a Cocker Spaniel ###
As children, sometimes our best friends in the entire world are those of the animal kingdom. Canine companions can play a powerful role in a child's life, and anyone whose ever loved their dog will tell you they found a best friend in four legs and a wagging tail. From playing tag, to romping through the woods, to having a soft ear to cry on, it's these heartfelt emotions of human and dog relationships that Joyce Sidman captures in her book of young adult poetry, _The World According to Dog_.
A gentle work that goes out of its way to present dogs through a lot of different eyes, _The World According to Dog_, embraces a multimodal format, and doesn't limiting itself to traditional ideas of what makes a book a book. Mixing Joyce Sidman's poetic work with stories of dogs as told by teenage writers, the poetry of _The World According to Dog_ features black and white photography by Doug Mindell which provides the reader with visual insight into every poem. This is a book that uses language to touch all five senses, and the images it creates will resonate with the reader long after the last page has been turned.
Mindell's photos do a lot to enhance Sidman's poems, and it's obvious the two worked closely together to find poems and pictures that would match. "What Your Ears Remind Me Of" is accompanied by a shot of the velvet soft, leathery ears of a beagle. Often shot with a blurred lens from less than four feet above the ground, Mindell's black and white photos let us see the world through a dog's eyes. It's a world where smell is more important than sight, and somehow that comes across in the photography, possibly do to the large number of doggy noses Mindell uses as subject matter for his work.
Photos are used to enhance the poetry, and the poetry itself is born of prose. By letting her poetry complement the voices of her young contributors, Sidman not only tells a story of a dog's world but a kid's world as well. From Anna Engstrom's story, "Hey, Comet!" we are presented with the idea that, "After receiving Comet, we realize that our dog had a lot to learn. 1. Our house is not a bathroom" (Sidman 6). Sidman builds on the idea of learning new things and translates them into doggy thoughts in "How to Meet a New Idea (Base on the Study of a Dog)": "Test the air. / Approach with interest: / ears open, / eyes bright" (Sidman 8) For anyone who's ever watched a dog investigate something, those four lines can create a very vivid picture. True, we might not all be seeing the same dog, but that's part of the appeal of Sidman's subject matter: dogs are everybody's friends.
Visual images aren't the only things that mark Sidman's poetry though. Her titles are profoundly powerful. Often nothing more than a single word, they set the stage, point you in the right direction, and then encourage you to follow your nose through a labyrinthine corridor of language. Take "Noses" for example: "I / might detect / wet earth, / rank fists of marigolds, / the distant tsunami / of skunk. / You / are sorting out / the relative age of / squirrels / that passed this way / last week" (Sidman 11) Language so powerful that it preys upon the olfactory sense is an incredible achievement, so it's almost no surprise that _The World According to Dog_ won a BCCB Blue Ribbon Nonfiction Book award.
Beginning with "Awakening", "I dream of deep-sea / fishing: awake to find dog / breathing in my face" Sidman's poems take you on a romp through the woods, "Always Take a Dog", naps in the sun, "The Usual Spots", a roll in some olfactory offensive concoction, "Stink", and every other facet of a dog's life (Sidman 1). There are poems about puppy love, dog days, and the dog-eat-dog world we all inhabit together. She ends her collection with the poem "Shedding", a quiet reflection on the pervasiveness of dogs in our lives and the powerful bond that's shared between a canine companion and its owner. "I sleep, warm, under / its soft scattering... / It is everywhere, placed mysteriously as God... / a long, pale strand to the light -- / not black, like yours -- / a memory of the dog / who came before" (Sidman 64).
Delightfully engaging all five senses, and filled to the brim with simple language, Joyce Sidman's poems in _The World According to Dog_ are proof that blank verse doesn't have to be doggerel. These poems will capture the heart of anyone who's ever owned a dog, doggedly pursuing their shoe strings and nipping at their heels, waiting to be admired, loved, and appreciated simply for what they are. Sidman's work is proof that some of our best subject matter can be the world around us, and poetry is as much the playground of children and animals as it is the world of adults.
