## Background ##

This is another _Mitchell Family Cookbook_ recipe from Aunt Jean.

## Ingredients ##

* 2 cups soft bread crumbs
* 1 minced onion

* 1 pound ground veal shoulder
* 6 strips bacon
* 1 beaten egg
* 0.75 cups milk
* 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
* 1.5 teaspoons salt
* a dash of pepper

## Preparation ##

Preheat over to 350 degrees. Combine egg, milk, seasoning, salt, and pepper and
let stand 5 minutes. Add onion and meat and mix well. Line a loaf pan (8 x 5 x 3

from oven, invert onto a cookie sheet, set over to 400 degrees, and return
meatloaf to oven for 10 minutes to crisp bacon.
