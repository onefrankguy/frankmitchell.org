Via [Seth Godin][]:

> "Desire to be three steps ahead. One step is easy. One step isn't enough. If you're only one step ahead, you'll get creamed before you launch. Two steps is tempting. Two steps means that everyone understands what you're up to when you pitch them. Two steps means that you can get funded in no time. Two steps is a problem. It's a problem because the smart guys are three steps ahead. They're the groundbreakers and the pathfinders. They're the ones inventing the next generation. It's harder to sell, harder to build and harder to get your mother-in-law to understand, but that's what's worth building."

Lots of other good stuff in there too, but that's the one that jumped out at me and said, "Yeah, that's what Al does".
