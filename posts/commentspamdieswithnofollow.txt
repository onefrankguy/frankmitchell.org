Title: Comment spam dies with nofollow

In what amounts to a fantastic move towards killing comment spam, [Google][], [Yahoo][], [Six Apart][], and [MSN][] now all support the `rel="nofollow"` attribute on hyperlinks. Other blog software providers, like [WordPress][], will no doubt follow shortly.

Basically, if a search engine spider comes across the `rel="nofollow"` attribute on one of your hyperlinks, it won't follow that link. So if your blogging software automatically adds that attribute to all the links it accepts as input, comment spam doesn't get followed (and thus doesn't go into the search engine).

Of course, non-spam links won't get followed either, so we're still going to need some sort of [filter][] to separate good links from bad ones. Or we could just let services like [Technorati][] and [Pingback][] / [TrackBack][] do that for us.

Hat tip to [Russell Bettie][] for the info.
