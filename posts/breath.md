Silence encased  
Enfolded in darkness  
Perfect stillness  
Nothing but  
Breath  

In out  
Slow perfect  
Miniature circles  
In an airless void  

Tiny eddies currents  
Pool form gather  

One different  
Intent forms  
Conscious thought  
Squeezes to nothing  
Explodes  

Softly gathering  
Patterns of chaos meld  
Form rhythms  

## Original snippet from "Harmonica" ##

Just voice.  
And breath.  
And tongue.  
And lips.  
And teeth.  
Like kissing.
