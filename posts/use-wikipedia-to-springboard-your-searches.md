"Siri, how does a voltage divider work?"

I'm pretty sure this is where most queries start. Make a request of your phone
and let speech-to-text translators and relevance ranking algorithms take it from
there. Like magic the answer appears. But what if it's not the right answer?
What do you do then?

## Look it up in an encyclopedia ##

When I ask [Wikipedia][] about spiders, I get an article about eight legged
arthropods with venomous fangs. When I ask Google about spiders, I get
recommendations to play Spider Solitaire. One of them understands that the term
"spider" refers to the creature. The other understands that I like mobile games.

The problem with asking a search engine anything, is that the response will be
tailored to what the corporation behind the engine thinks you want, rather than
what you want. But an encyclopedia is a biased collection of facts.
