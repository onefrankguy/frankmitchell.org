## Background ##

This is _the_ traditional Christmas beverage at my house. This recipe comes from
the _Mitchell Family Cookbook_ which means it's Grandmas'.

## Ingredients ##

* 3 quarts milk
* 3 cups sugar
* 2 tablespoons vanilla
* 12 eggs

## Preparation ##

Beat the eggs in a blender. Cook milk and sugar in a double boiler until very
hot. Slowly stir in eggs. Don't let the water in the bottom of the boiler boil!
Stir almost continuously for 45 minutes to an hour. Once done, let it cool and
add the vanilla. Continue to stir while cooling. Refrigerate and enjoy.

## Notes ##

My grandmother is the only person who can make this without any lumps. If your
boiled custard has lumps when it's done, use Aunt Linda's trick. Put it in the
blender and delumpify it.
