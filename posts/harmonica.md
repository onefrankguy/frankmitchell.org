Plastic comb.  
Twenty reeds.  
Ten holes.  
Black box.  
Oskar brand.  
Fourteen dollars.  
Bright metal.  
Soft sound.  
Copper taste.  
Much spit.  
Last instrument.  
Not guitar.  
No calluses.  
Not piano.  
No pedals.  
Just voice.  
And breath.  
And tongue.  
And lips.  
And teeth.  
Like kissing.  

Straight harp,  
C chord.  
Old songs.  
Lone Ranger.  
My Sunshine.  
Red River.  
No applause.  
Dust collector.  
Many years.  
In box.  
In pocket.  
Time passes.  
People come.  
People go.  

Harp remains.  
In college.  
Pull out.  
Fingers curl.  
Familiar metal.  
Top plate.  
Red rust.  
Clean it.  
Bright again.  
Instruction book.  
Cross harp,  
G chord.  
Blow one.  
Draw two.  
Do dah.  
Do dah.  
Much sound.  
No music.  

Tap tongue.  
Cup hands.  
Keep playing.  
In car.  
On street.  
By park.  
Draw in.  
Note curls.  
Falls down.  
Rises again.  
Long silence.  
Then...  

Late night,  
Talk loud,  
Blues sound.  

## Developing an idea -- kissing ##

I have here in my notes that I need to do something with the following lines:
"Just voice. / And breath. / And tongue. / And lips. / And teeth. / Like kissing."
Not within this poem, but my writing group said they would like to see the idea
built into a poem of its own.

Don't know; we'll see. Kissing is not a subject near and dear to me, so I
don't know that I've got enough material to draw from.

> "Kissing---and I mean like, yummy, smacking kissing---is the most delicious,
> most beautiful and passionate thing that two people can do, bar none."

> Drew Barrymore

However, enough people have talked about kissing, that I could probably make a
poem out of kissing quotes. Stolen kisses maybe. Something balladic and old
fashioned romantic with knights and dragons and damsels in distress; I could see
that working out.
