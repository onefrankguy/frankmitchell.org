### Background ###

This is my mother's recipe for carmel popcorn, one of those really tasty / snacky foods that's just fun to eat. Note to self: get Stefan's mother's recipe for carmel popcorn, the one that includes peanut butter.

### Ingredients ###

* 1 cup molasses
* 1 cup unpopped corn
* 1 cup nuts
* 1 stick of butter
* 1 cup shredded coconut
* 1 tablespoon barley malt

### Preparation ###

Mix all the ingredients, _except_ the barley malt, and bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Stir every 5-10 minutes until all the corn is popped. Cool slightly, and toss with the barley malt.
