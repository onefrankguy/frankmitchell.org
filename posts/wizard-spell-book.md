title: Never ask a wizard if you can read his spell book
date: 25 October 2010

All the really good wizards keep spell books. These little tomes, usually
[Moleskines][], sometimes [composition books][], are filled with phone numbers,
snippets of code, records of conversations, and if you're really lucky, a
password or two. In short, anything a wizard might want to remember.

The best wizards use their spell books not only as a memory aid, but also as a
record of the magic they've performed. When it comes to solving a new problem,
or trying out a new piece of code, they hypothesize and observe, keeping a
record of what works and what doesn't. This lets them learn from their failures,
advancing their craft even further.

## Wizards like to talk about magic ##

Ask a wizard about [a piece of magic][], and he will gladly talk about the
[data structures and algorithms][] behind it, sharing freely of his
[insights and observations][]. In fact, [entire communities][] have sprung up
based around the concept of wizards sharing magic.

Wizards know that ideas are worthless. Thanks to the internet, finding a piece
of magic that will bring your idea into reality is just a search away. However,
what you find will only get you 90% of the way there.  Getting the last 10%,
binding multiple spells together and actually shipping something, that requires
insight.

Insight is what you find in a spell book.

## Spell books are best kept private ##

Ask a wizard if you can read his spell book, and you'll be refused. It's not
that the wizard doesn't want to share what they know. It's that they know you
don't have the framework to understand what they've written.

Because spell books contain records of *le exp&eacute;rience*, both the
experiment and the experience, they are intensely personal things. They hold a
record of the labyrinthine thoughts in a wizard's mind at the moment he brings
something into reality. Such maps are not easily translated, and attempts by
others to follow them often lead to misunderstandings.

So wizards keep their spell books secret.

## You can't walk someone else's path ##

Any experience worth having is one you have to chart yourself. The instant you
try to compose insight into a map for others to follow, the insight is lost. The
map becomes worthless.

You can give people tools to draw their own maps, but most people don't want
that kind of work. They want checklists and steps, recipes and instructions.
Human nature makes us crave rules and fear freedom.

Computational wizardry doesn't work that way. There are no shortcuts to having
insights. You just have to put in the time, fail again and again, and eventually
you'll wind up with something brilliant.

Of course, there are shortcuts to [failing faster][].
