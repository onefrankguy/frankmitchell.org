### Background ###

I pulled this off the internet one day when Sarah and I were looking for a tomato soup recipe.

### Ingredients ###

* 1 tablespoon butter
* 1.5 cups chopped onion
* 1 large clove crushed garlic
* 0.5 teaspoons salt
* 2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary
* 2 teaspoons minced fresh basil
* freshly ground black pepper
* 3.5 cups peeled, cooked tomatoes
* 3 tablespoons dry sherry
* 0.25 teaspoons honey
* 4 ounces cream cheese
* fresh parsley

### Preparation ###

In saucepan cook onions and garlic in butter with salt until onions are soft and translucent. Add herbs and pepper and saute a little longer. Add tomatoes, sherry and honey. Cover and simmer 30-40 minutes. Cut cream cheese into small cubes and add to hot soup. Stir until cheese is melted and soup is smooth. Serve topped with parsley. Serves 4. Freezes well. Recipe can be doubled.

### Notes ###

You can omit the sherry and rosemary if you can't find it. Dry ingredients work in a pinch if fresh ones can't be found. Stewed tomatoes out of a can work just as well as cooking and peeling your own, and it's a lot faster too.
