### Threads of ideas ###

There's a very interesting [discussion][] taking place on the TTLG Thief Fan Missions forum at the moment. Vigil brought up the point that he'd recently replayed [Lord Edmund Entertains][LEE], and it was a lot more fun than some of the new missions that have appeared recently.

The question is why?

### Flawless introduction ###

> "Dear Lady Bernhard,"

> "The tenth annual meeting of our small society is at hand, and as usual, I will be acting as the host. I have fully stocked the pantry and prepared for your arrival to the best of my ability. I will be expecting you and Duke Creygan no later than noon on the tenth. We will celebrate with a feast and good wine before descending to my vault. Remember to keep your visit secret even from your closest friends. We do not want any uninvited guests."

> "I remain faithfully yours,"

> "Lord Edmund."
