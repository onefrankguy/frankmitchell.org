I just spent the last thirty minutes manually sorting through a months worth of
email. Guess what? Most of it was useless. Of two-hundred plus messages, only
five turned out to be worth keeping active as reminders. The rest got archived.

[Thunderbird][] does a wonderful job of sorting out real mail from junk mail,
but what I'd really like is a Bayesean filter that would prioritize my email for
me.
