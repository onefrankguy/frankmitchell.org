title: Never ask a wizard if he can use a lightning rod

I've spent a lot of time on both sides of the technical interview fence, and one
of the questions that comes up time and again is this:

"On a scale from 1 to 10, how familiar are you with a lightning rod?"

Of course, no one says, "lightning rod." They ask about C++, or Java, or Rails,
or Cocoa, or whatever the current language or framework they're using happens to
be.

Given that engineers are notoriously bad at estimating things, and that any
answer you're going to get is so full of subjectivity that it's useless, I've
started using the following response when asked, "Regarding [insert a language
or framework here], would you rate yourself as a beginner, intermediate, or
expert user?"

## I am a wizard. ##

When I graduated from wizard school I knew more about [lightning rods][] than
the other students, thus I was an expert. When I started work I knew less about
lightning rods than my colleges, thus I was a beginner. After working for
several years, I knew more than some, but less than others, thus I was of
indeterminate knowledge.

I am the only person worth measuring myself against, so instead of confining
myself to your little box, I will tell you instead of the spells I have cast and
the magic I have compiled. Then you may judge my knowledge against whatever
standard you see fit.

I have spent enough time with lightning rods to long for [reflection][] and
[multiple dispatch][], and have woven [meta spells][] that faked them.

I have learned of the [virulent nature of `const`][const], and have been bitten
by the many headed beast the compiler invokes when no one's watching.

I have laughed at the myth of [reusable magic][], yet have seen children reuse
spells in [less complicated environments][scratch] with better results.

I have lamented the publication of [*Magical Patterns*][gof], knowing that only
a handful of the greatest wizards understood [the ideas behind them][pl].

I have [tamed a dragon][], watched monsters [eat their young][], and been
dazzled by the terse beauty inherent in [simple incantations][].

I am a wizard, and while lightning rods are a part of my craft, they are not the
whole of it. The things I can do for you lie not in that parlor trick realm but
in the far deeper realm of computational wizardry.
