### Background ###

These are a traditional Christmas cookie in my house, and this is Mom's recipe which she got from Grandma.

### Ingredients ###

* 6.75 cups flour
* 1 cup butter
* 1 cup sugar
* 1.25 teaspoons cinnamon
* 0.5 teaspoons ground cloves
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 0.5 teaspoons allspice
* 1.25 teaspoons nutmeg
* 4.5 teaspoons anise seed
* 2 eggs
* 1 cup molasses
* 0.25 cups water

### Preparation ###

Dissolve baking soda in water. Beat eggs. Sift flour and set aside. Mix butter and sugar; add spices, anise seed, and eggs. This is your cream mixture. Combine molasses and baking soda water and then add it to the cream mixture. Add flour and mix well. Chill dough until firm and then roll into 0.5 inch ropes. Slice the ropes into 1 inch segments with a butter knife. Bake on a greased cookie sheet at 400 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes.
