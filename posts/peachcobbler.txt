### Background ###

Quite possibly the best dessert ever, this is Mom's recipe for peach cobbler.

### Ingredients ###

* 8 ripe peaches
* 1 pound cake
* 1 cup sugar
* 0.5 cups flour
* 4 tablespoons cornstarch
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 egg yokes
* 5 cups of milk
* 2 teaspoons vanilla
* a pinch of salt

### Preparation ###

Peel and slice the peaches, sugar to taste and let stand. Crumble the pound cake and set aside. Warm 4 cups of milk. Beat the egg yokes and combine them with the other cup of milk. Mix the dry ingredients together (except the pound cake) and add the milk / egg combination. Stir well. Mix in the warm milk, and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until thickened. Remove from heat and add 2 tablespoons of vanilla and the butter. Cool. This is your custard. Alternate layers of cake crumbs, peaches, and custard in a deep desert dish. Refrigerate several hours and then enjoy.
