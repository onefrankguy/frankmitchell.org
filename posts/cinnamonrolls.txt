### Background ###

Another recipe from the _Mitchell Family Cookbook_, this one comes from my aunt Linda.

### Ingredients ###

* 2 packets dry yeast
* 2 cups unbleached flour
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 0.5 cups honey
* 1.5 cups warm water
* 2 eggs
* 6 tablespoons melted shortening
* 2 cups whole grain flour
* brown sugar
* cinnamon

### Preparation ###

Mix yeast, unbleached flour, salt, and honey. Add the eggs and shortening. Mix in the whole grain flour, adding more if necessary without letting the dough lose its stickiness. Set dough aside, cover with a damp towel, and let it rise until double in size. Once risen, divide dough in half, and roll each half out into long logs. Roll the logs in a mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon. Roll the dough out into long logs again, and cut the log into roll sized segments. Place on a greased cookie sheet with the rolls touching and allow them to rise slightly. Bake at 350 degrees for 20 to 30 minutes.
