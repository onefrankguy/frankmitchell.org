### Background ###

My mother and I are both lovers of chocolate, and about the only time we drink alcohol is when we're together. Hence, chocolate martinis! The [recipe][] comes from a random Google [search][], and all conversions were done via [Google][].

### Ingredients ###

* 3.5 grams of baking chocolate
* 4.5 ounces of vodka
* 2.25 ounces of orange liquor
* 4.5 ounces of coconut milk
* 2.25 ounces of heavy whipping cream
* 1 tupperware blender
* sugar
* ice

### Preparation ###

Melt chocolate in a double boiler. Slowly stir in vodka. Melt in coconut milk. Pour orange liquor, whipping cream, and ice into the tupperware blender. Add chocolate sauce. Shake well. Strain into wine glasses and serve. Add sugar and cream as needed to taste.

### Notes ###

I was generally agreed by all parties involved (my mother and I) that this drink, as the recipe dictates above, is not nearly sweet enough for our tastes. That, and there's way too much alcohol in it. Needless to say, we're going to experiment with using sweet chocolate instead of baker's chocolate, and lowering the alcohol content. We'll see how things turn out.
