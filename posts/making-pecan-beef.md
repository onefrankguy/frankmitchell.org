-->

"Taste this."

"What is it?"

"A pecan."

"It's delicious! What did you do to it?"

"Cooked it for about three minutes in hot oil."

"You mean you fried it?"

The best part of making pecan beef is definitely the fried pecans. They're
crunchy, oily, an oh so delicious.

## Ingredients ##

* 1 pound top round steak
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 0.5 cups boiling water
* 1 tablespoon corn starch
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 0.5 cups chopped raw pecans
* 0.5 cups chopped onion
* 2 cloves minced garlic
* 4 cups chopped bok choy
* 0.5 cups sliced bamboo shoots

## Directions ##

Slice the steak into thin strips. Blend the soy sauce and water then set aside.
[Preheat a cast iron skillet][1] then add the vegetable oil. Stir-fry the pecans
for 3 minutes. Remove the pecans. Add the onion and garlic and stir-fry 1
minute. Add the bok choy and stir-fry 1 minute more. Remove the vegetables.
Stir-fry the steak until it's cooked all the way through. Don't cook it too long
or it'll get tough. Stir the soy sauce mixture into the beef. Cook until it
thickens and bubbles. Mix the bamboo shoots in with the vegetables. Add the
vegetables to the beef, then cover and cook for 1 more minute.

## Notes ##

This is lovely served over a bed of rice. If you want less of a mustard flavor,
you can substitute spinach for the bok choy and been sprouts for the bamboo. It
makes about 4 servings.
