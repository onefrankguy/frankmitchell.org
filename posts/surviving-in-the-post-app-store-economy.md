As this years Steam Summer Sale winds to a close, I find myself asking

> "Where does the market go when everyone has a walled garden?"

Steam was the first app store I ever encountered. A friend got me hooked in
2006, touting them as a way to get the games you own on every device you own.
This was about three years after they released.

There wasn't much on Steam in the beginning. Valve's own titles where there,
plus some stuff from id and Eidos. Maybe a hundred games in total. Today there
are thousands of games on Steam. Forbes estimates they may account for up to
70% of all downloaded PC games.

But PC games aren't what most people think of when the phrase "app store" pops
up. Apple owns that brand with their iOS store. I got my first iPhone in 2010,
two years after the App Store went live.

The mobile market is a lot bigger than the PC games market. There might be
thousands of games on Steam, but there are millions of apps on the App Store.
And Apple isn't alone in that market. Google Play launched three months after
the App Store to fill the gap for Android users. Microsoft joined the party
in 2010 with the Windows Phone Store, and Amazon opened their Kindle store to
developers that same year.
