As the Steam Summer Sale winds to a close, I find myself asking

> "Where does the market go when everyone has a walled garden?"

Steam was the first app store I ever encountered. A friend got me hooked in
2006, touting them as a way to get the games you own on every device you own.
This was about three years after they released.

There wasn't much on Steam in the beginning. Valve's own titles where there,
plus some stuff from id and Eidos. Maybe a hundred games in total. Today there
are thousands of games on Steam. Forbes estimates [they may account for up to
70% of all downloaded PC games][forbes].

But PC games aren't what most people think of when the phrase "app store" pops
up. Apple owns that brand with their iOS store. I got my first iPhone in 2010,
two years after the App Store went live.

The mobile market is a lot bigger than the PC games market. There might be
thousands of games on Steam, but there are millions of apps on the App Store.
And Apple isn't alone in that market. Google Play launched three months after
the App Store to fill the gap for Android users. Microsoft joined the party
in 2010 with the Windows Phone Store, and Amazon opened their Kindle store to
developers that same year.

Digital distribution is hot right now. Every publisher wants their own virtual
store front. You maximize profits if you aren't giving thirty percent to Steam
or Apple. Every device owner wants applications that feel native. You want the
things you use to feel good. But that intersection leaves developers, the people
that build the games and apps, at a loss.

Traditional publishing has a developer boxing their software and shipping it to
a distribution center. A publisher then handles the business of getting that
software in all the relevant physical store fronts. App stores change that. Now
getting your game on Steam or Amazon or the Windows Phone Store is just part of
the development process. Developers have become their own publishers.

Knocking on the door of every walled garden isn't easy. Sure Amazon has a
software development kit and lots of documentation, but their SDK doesn't look
anything like the Steam one. Concepts you learn when developing on a Kindle
don't have one-to-one mappings onto an iPhone. You can argue that's the nature
of software, every library is different, but when that nature creates a barrier
to shipping your product, it poses a problem.

It also creates an opportunity.
