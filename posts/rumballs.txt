### Background ###

There are quite possibly my favorite Christmas cookie. This recipe for them comes from my mother. It's the one she sent me to college with.

### Ingredients ###

* 3 cups Oreo cookie crumbs
* 1 cup confectioner's sugar
* 3 cups finely chopped nuts (pecans)
* 4 tablespoons cocoa
* 4 tablespoons light corn syrup
* 0.5 cups rum

### Preparation ###

Mix the crumbs, sugar, nuts, and coca well. Add the corn syrup and rum. Using a fork, mix everything together. Roll into balls using about 1.5 tablespoons of crumbs. Roll in confectioner's sugar and store air tight.

### Notes ###

Makes about 60-75 balls.

Important: Don't drink the rum while making these! As [Jill][] found out last Christmas, you'll end up with rum sludge instead of rum balls if you do. Not that rum sludge is bad, it's just a lot harder to share with friends.
