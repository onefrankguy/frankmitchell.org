## Background ##

Mom wanted to serve Cosmopolitans with Christmas Eve dinner. Molly had made them
when they'd done a girl's party earlier in the year, and everyone involved
thought they were excellent. While she wasn't able to provide us with an exact
recipe, experimentation provided the results below.

## Ingredients ##

* 2 teaspoons of vodka
* 1 teaspoon of orange liquor
* 0.5 teaspoons of lime juice
* sparking pear juice
* ice

## Preparation ##

Mix vodka, orange liquor, and lime juice. Poor into the bottom of a wine glass.
Add ice. Fill the wine glass the rest of the way with sparkling pear juice. Mix
well and enjoy.

## Notes ##

You can substitute sparkling cranberry, strawberry, apple, etc. juice in place
of the pear if you want too. However, the combination of sweet pear and tart
lime ends up being both refreshing and lip-smacking good.
