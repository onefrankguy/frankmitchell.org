#### Perfection in the Human Form <br /> (Leonardo da Vinci's Cannon) ####

Do you know what it's like?  
To be hung on a wall.  
To stand up straight and tall.  
To not let your arms fall.  
'Til the days work is done.  
And goodbye goes the sun.  
There's a crick in your back.  
You can never relax.  
Do you know what it's like?

No you don't!

You can't know what it's like!  
You are flesh; you are bone.  
And you live in your home.  
Where you write your dumb poem.  
Having nary a clue.  
That I have a job too.  
To be perfect all day!  
So I'd just like to say,  
You can't know what it's like!

No you can't!

Damn the man!  
I didn't want to be,  
This perfect model of humanity.  
Damn the man!  
I didn't want to do  
Jumping jacks all day in this glass zoo.  
Damn the man!  
Damn the man!  
Damn the man!

Yes, I am a bitter picture.  
Yes, I am humanity perfected.  
Yes, I do have perfect teeth.

And that's more than Mona Lisa can say.

### [Jessamyn Schnackenberg][]'s comments - 29 October 2004 ###

> "playful and highly vocal - the rhymes that come in 3s (lines 2-4, 12-14) seem more ominous, final, and aesthetically purposeful than those in 2s (which are more, perhaps, coy, exasperated/humorous/playful)"

> "at times [the rhymes] seem to compete to determine tone - what do you intend tone to be read as?"

> "fantastic line and image [refers to line 26 'Jumping jacks all day in this glass zoo']"

> "a witty punchline [last 3 lines] - perhaps yeilds and compelling tension that might be drawn out (though perhaps isn't in this poem) [can't read this word] how this sketch possesses a voice and a humanity that a fleshed out portrait cannot attain"
