### Introduction ###

Frank Mitchell is a Computer Science and Writing major who believes that language will eventually bridge the gab between humanity and technology.

His poetry doesn't reflect that philosophy.

Instead, Microverse is simply a tiny collection of tiny poems, little pieces of verse that found a home outside themselves and in the company of each other.
