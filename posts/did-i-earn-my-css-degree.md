title: Did I earn my CS degree?

I used to advocate [teaching Ruby in schools][rubyinschools]. Why force students
to struggle with C when they could be learning a "more useful" language? I was
wrong.

I used to think that it was the job of a university to prepare me for the job
market, that schools should be teaching "hot" languages like Java and C#. That's
not their job at all.

Somehow I got the idea that computer scientist was just academia speak for
programmer. Being a computer scientist is not about maintaining legacy code.

I'm going to graduate in May with my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science,
and I'm not sure that I've earned the degree.

Being a computer scientist means having the technical expertise to implement
something like the [MapReduce][] algorithm. It means having the vision to dream
up an interface as novel as that of [Sketchpad][]. But in order to do those
things you have to have to understand the basic principles, and it is there that
I think my education is lacking.

Unlike a lot of the students in my [compiler's class][], I do understand
[pointers and recursion][]. But I know that I'm missing fundamentals like
[Lambda Calculus][]. Why, oh why, was I never given more than a cursory
introduction to [Lisp][]? There are [answers][] [out][] [there][], if you're
willing to accept them. Computer science has become pop culture, and companies
like Microsoft are insisting that people like my mother learn to write code.
(See Sriram Krisnan's essay, [Lisp is sin][].)

Ultimately, any fault in my education lies with me. So I guess it's about time
to start reading the [wizard book][].
