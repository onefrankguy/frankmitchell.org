People cook things with microwaves all the time, so why not with [cell phones][]? Yes, those little rubber duck antennas are omnidirectional, and if they put out enough juice to boil an egg in three minutes, what are they doing to your brain?

Though the geek in me really wants to try this. Anyone up for some mobile cooking?
