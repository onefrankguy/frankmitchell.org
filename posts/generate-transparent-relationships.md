I was messing around with fravia's [Web Economy Bullshit Generator][webg] and I
happened to generate the title of this page:

> "generate transparent relationships"

The immediate thought that came to my mind had to do with human machine
interaction. What if it was transparent?

I just received an iPAQ as a gift from Microsoft, and trying to incorporate it
into my daily routine has been something of a challenge. It's handwriting
recognition engine is amazing, but it takes about a second for that little
processor to translate my cursive into Unicode text.

For me, a transparent relationship would be one where my iPAQ acted as a
replacement for my [Hipster PDA][]. Just let me write on a blank screen (but
don't bother to translate my text into something a computer can understand),
date and time stamp all my notes, and provide me with two buttons to navigate
forward and backward and a button to create a new page.

Generate transparent relationships. When will we start to see digital devices
that behave as simply and reliably as their analogue counterparts?

Addendum: If I could get Linux running on my iPAQ, no doubt I could build my own
digital Hipster.
