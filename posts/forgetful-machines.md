Reading Anne Galloway's post about [a forgetting machine][] got me thinking
about how we view computer memory. No doubt about it, the stuff's getting
cheeper every day, and we're rapidly approaching a paradigm where we won't have
to worry about storage space. Instead all information will be digitized and
available at our fingertips.

But is that what we really want?

Machines capable of storing and retrieving all the information in the world will
also be capable of bombarding us with it. Augmenting our thought process,
they'll draw connections we can't make.
