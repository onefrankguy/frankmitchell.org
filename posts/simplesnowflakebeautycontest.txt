I'm thinking at stealing a [MIT idea][] and doing something similar for ACM this semester. Don't know what we'd offer in terms of prizes, but I'm sure Erik and I could come up with something.

> "Create the simplest program that generates the most beautiful snowflake."

Since beauty is in the eye of the beholder, that one's obviously left up to the judges. But I wonder if we can come up with a rubric for judging simplicity in code? Number of lines, readability, complexity (Big O) of the [algorithm][] used.

Have to think about that some more.

Do we want to limit snowflakes to [text only][], or should this be an anything goes competition? I like the limit that text imposes, since it puts everyone on the same playing field and doesn't give the coder with mad OpenGL / Java skills the best chance of winning. 

Thanks to John Maeda for [the idea][] behind this.
