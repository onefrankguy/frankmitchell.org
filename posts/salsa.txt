### Background ###

This is my grandmother's salsa recipe as it appears in the _Mitchell Family Cookbook_.

### Ingredients ###

* 7 quarts peeled ripe tomatoes
* 1 pound ground / chopped jalapenos
* 2 large onions
* 5 cloves of garlic
* 3 teaspoons salt
* 1 cup vinegar
* 0.25 cups sugar

### Preparation ###

Grind tomatoes, peppers, onions, and garlic. Mix all ingredients. Bring everything to a boil in a large pot and cook it on low for about 2 hours, or until thick. Put in pint jars and submerge jars in hot water for 20 minutes. 

### Notes ###

This recipe makes 7 pints!

You don't have to boil the ingredients if you don't want to. You can just mix everything and put it in the pint jars raw if you want. But I don't think it keeps for as long if you do.
