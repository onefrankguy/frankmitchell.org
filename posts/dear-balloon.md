I watched you kiss  
The edge of space  
With eyes that shone  
Of ones and zeroes.  
Languages, that no one else would ever understand.  

Knowing that this is  
The closest I have ever  
Come to childhood dreams  
Of playing in star fields.  
The same dreams I share with, my father's father.  

Thank you for those dreams  
Carried on stardust wings  
By a sun soaked circle of  
Heaven filled with helium  
That rose up to dance with the angels as they make their star crossing.
