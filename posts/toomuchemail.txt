Title: Too much email

I just spent the last thirty minutes manually sorting through a months worth of email. Guess what? Most of it was useless. Of two-hundred plus messages, only five turned out to be worth keeping active as reminders. The rest got archived.

[Thunderbird][] does a wonderful job of sorting out real mail from junk mail, but what I'd really like is a Bayesean filter that would prioritize my email for me.
