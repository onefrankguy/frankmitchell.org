From an [essay][] by William Beatty via [Seth Godin][]:

> "The road to failure often contains:

> 1. Secrecy.
> 2. The conviction that someone is about to steal your idea.
> 3. Focus on selling your idea to the government or a big corporation.
> 4. Loss of humility and focus on fame.
> 5. Belief that scientists and businesses (the smart ones) will hail your discovery."

Note to self: Don't go wondering down that path. Communication among everyone is important, otherwise you'll end up with team members who go into "angry programmer mode".
