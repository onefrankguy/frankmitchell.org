Tags as concepts, ideas, spaces

### Merging tags ###

1. Drop the plural morphemes: cats == cat
2. Acronym expansion: ny == "new york"

Both can be combined in the same storage space; both end up doing the same
thing. Morphemes map to each other. Bidirectional mapping. Unidirection: needed,
wanted? Probably not.

### Self-organizing tag spaces ###

Don't overwhelm the user. Cover 90% of the information space. That's good
enough. Maybe a fuzzy number filter. Evaluate how often a tag is used. Is this
often enough? Language as a basis for this selection.

Rare tags don't need to be shown. Overlapping of tags will ensure those nodes
with rare tags are eventually shown.

Fuzzy number filter can be controlled via contributing percentage of a given
tag. Tag must be associated with at least n% of total nodes.

### Browsing tag spaces ###

Let users define intersections. Pick from a list. No need for URLs (command
line) interface. Select / deselect -> same operation, click the tag.

Do we need to keep a separate viewable list of what's been selected, or can we
simply change colors in our list of all tags?

### Combining tag spaces ###

Can we merge two people's tag spaces? What tags are common to both of them?
