## Where we go from here ##

This is the third part in a multi-part series about building the NorCal
40A transceiver. Links to the other parts are below.

1. [Building my first HF radio][norcal-40a]
2. [Learning how a transmit filter works][transmit-filter]
3. Regulating voltage with junk box parts

For the curious, photos where taken with an [iPhone 5][], cropped and resized
with [Acorn][], and compressed with [ImageOptim][]. Schematics where drawn with
[circuitikz][] and graphs where created with [D3][].
