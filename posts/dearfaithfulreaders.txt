### On the lack of recent updates ###

To make a long story short, my [Movable Type][] system broke, and I've been searching for a replacement ever since. The much touted [WordPress][] does not fit my needs, nor do any of the other solutions out there. Believe me, I have googled them all, and tried them all. Until [TypeWorks][] comes out, I'm rolling my own.

Thus, I give you Elimossinary. A simplistic web publishing system designed to make my life a little easier. At the moment, only article publishing, comment adding, and RSS feed generating / auto discovering are supported. Archive browsing is the next item on my to do list.

Hmm... Apparently while putting Elimossinary together, I wrote a couple of recursive mod_rewrite rules, and so [Modwest][] has suspended my access to my .htaccess files. Not cool, as it means I don't get pretty URLs. Until I get that sorted out, updates can be viewed [in the ususal place][home], and my RSS feed is accessable [someplace else][rss].

Because the system is still in beta (especially the comments via email), don't be surprised if things change suddenly over the next few days.
