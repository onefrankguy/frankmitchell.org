### Gender of nouns ###

Adding an "-in-" to an Esperanto noun makes it specifically female. "Father" is "patro"; "mother is patrino". Adding a "vir-" prefix makes a noun specifically male. It's rare that you have to mark sex, but it's advisable to avoid using the root form of a word as the male form if there's going to be a chance of ambiguity.

### Plural nouns ###

Nouns are made plural by adding a "-j" ending on to them. So "sons" is "filoj", "pens" is "plumoj", and "girls" (as an object noun) is "knabinojn".

### Negation of adjectives ###

Adjectives in Esperanto are negated by prefixing them with "mal-". So "bad" is "malbona", "cold" is "malvarma", and "dirty" is "malpura". 

### Adjective agreement ###

The adjective ending must agree with the noun it describes. So, if the noun is an object (-n), the adjective must also be an object. If the noun is plural (-j), the adjective must also be plural.
