### Blogs are one-way publications ###

It's true. Forums, like [TTLG][], are much better suited for group communication
than blogs are. However, the development of technologies like [TrackBack][] and
[Pingback][] is pushing the blog towards being its own kind of conversation
space. With the advent of community oriented blog sites ([Livejournal][]) we're
starting to see [conversations][] that are akin to something you'd have on the
telephone.

That post, comment, response, pattern is an interesting one. Given that most
blog publishing software allows you to be notified via email when someone
replies to something you've posted, dealing with a flood of responses becomes
trivial for anyone who habitually checks their email several times a day.

Essentially, this turns a blog into a public repository for a bunch of one-line
emails. It's almost a merging of a blog and a forum, with the caveat that only
one person is allowed to create new forum posts. Therefore, it's one person's
ideas that drive the conversations, and so at its core, communication is still
one-way.

### Blogs are owned and branded ###

You almost have to meet on neutral ground for conversation to flourish. I spent
2+ hours talking on the phone with Sarah last night. The phone is both a natural
and a two-way communication space. Email (modeled after letter writing) is
similar. No one person owns an email conversation or phone conversation. No one
person decides what will and won't be said there.

But blogs are owned and branded. [Can't Count Sheep][] looks nothing like
[Scribbling.net][], and the ideas that Gina and I publish are our own. While I
may [talk about][] an idea she's published, I do so in my own space. My words
are my own, and they fit better in this space than they do in a tiny comment box
on someone else's site.

That's part of the reason why any comments you see here are going to be set off
as quotes. I filter comments and try to integrate them as extensions of my own
writings. They aren't my words or my ideas, but I want them to fit as naturally
into my personal space as they possibly can.

### Blogs can converse in their own space ###

> [Anja Rau][]

Tools like [TrackBack][] and [Pingback][] give bloggers some rudimentary power
over the discovery and auto-integration of the sites that link to them. They
allow each blogger to converse in their own space, while at the same time
ensuring that the links which connect the spaces together don't get lost.

[Technorati][] takes the concept even further by simply following the links that
bloggers naturally embed in their posts. It abstracts the conversation into a
non-owned space, thus freeing bloggers from having to track links themselves and
allowing conversations to develop more naturally. Everyone gets their own
soapbox, and no one has to worry about someone else's soapbox not fitting into
their design.

But as [Stephanie Hendrick][] points out in some of her research, that model
seems to be changing, and may not last into the future. There are fewer links
than there used to be:

> "i believe that weblogers are still communicating, but it is not nearly as
> easy to follow a conversation as it was even a year ago... people are linking
> less...but they are still communicating. i believe...that this particular
> group has already formed its inner core. they read each other and feel a
> strong enough tie to each other that they feel comfortable in using more
> personal ways of communicating (chat, email, etc)."

Communities are popping up all over the place ([Livejournal][] as an example
again), and once they're entrenched it's hard for outsiders to break into them.
They have their own terminology, their own inside jokes, and their own
conversations that take place outside of their blogs. Yet those conversations
directly color the material that gets posted to their blogs. So anyone doing
research might get left in the dark simply because they're not privy to the
entire conversation.

### Blogs are the future ###

> "...I think the key is to look at the blog _as a path towards a better
> designed conversation space_, not as the conversation space itself."

> [William Blaze][]

As [more][eric] and [more][linnea] of my friends get blogs of their own, I find
it harder and harder to talk myself into posting comments on their sites. I
don't want to have to register separate accounts on [Livejournal][], and
[Blogger][], and [deviantART][] just to leave comments. Heck, I don't even want
to have to type my comments into those inadequate little `<form>` fields.

I want to be able to comment in comort, not worry about how formatting will
affect things, know you'll receive my comment, and empower you (as the receiver
of my comment) to publish it or not as you see fit. After all, that blog is your
personal space, not mine. So lets use a pre-existing conversation space that's
designed to do just that.

Email.

Even that, however, is not a long term solution. Email has become so overrun
with spam these days that unless we develop [powerful filters][] to fight it,
email won't last long as a conversation space. Aggregation, however, might.

What if I can both read and respond to your blog with the same tool? Get message
via XML, send message via XML. How hard would that be? Develop a specification
for the sending side of things, and then let each blogging tool handle that
comment data in the way that works best for it and its user.

Now my interaction with your blog is transparent (which I like), and you can
still filter and preview messages before they're posted to your site (which you
like). Yes it's another communication protocol, but this time it's riding on top
of RSS and Atom, so it's not that big a jump from where we're headed now.

If I can get all my information in a single format, I aught to be able to
produce information that way as well.

### Final thoughts ###

My not understand the conversation space you're operating in isn't a bad thing.
My desire for a more flexible future-proof conversation space isn't bad either.
After all, as [Anja Rau][] says, "Blogs are about freedom of expression." It
simply means that I'd like our conversation spaces to evolve to take advantage
off _all_ the tools around us, and perhaps that yours are doing just that.
