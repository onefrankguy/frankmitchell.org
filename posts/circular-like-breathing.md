It's interesting how the web manages to weave back in on itself. I subscribe to
[Harp-L][], and yesterday I come across a link to Ben Felton's blog,
[Harmonica Ramblings][]. Digging through the archives there, I found [a post][]
that links to [Can't Count Sheep][], referencing my poem, [Harmonica][].

All these links run round in circles, kind of like [circular breathing][], which
is that trick you have to learn if you want to play the didgeridoo. It'd be
interesting to see a graph of all those links, a [spider][] that drew the web
like Ben Fry's [anemone][]. But until somebody writes one (and no that somebody
won't be me), I think I'll go back to playing my harmonica.
