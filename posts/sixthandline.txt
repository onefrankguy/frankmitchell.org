#### 6th and Line ####

Home is a brick building  
With too many doors that go in  
And not enough that go out

Home is full of engineering majors  
With too many numbers and symbols  
And not enough colors and life

Home is where the heart is.  
This city is where I live.

I was born in the desert.
