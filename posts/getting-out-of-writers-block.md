Writer's block is a plague, a gigantic suffering that leaves its victims dull
and uninspired. But it doesn't have to be that way. In his article,
["Hack your way out of writer's block"][hwb], Merlin Mann provides a neat little
list for getting up and out of the gutter.

Jerry Oltion takes the concept even further and gives us
["50 Strategies For Making Yourself Work"][myw]. It's an big list, but it makes
a lot of good points, especially about how many distractions (email, games,
radio, etc.) we allow into our lives when we sit down at a computer to write.

With ["Patching your personal suck"][pps], Merlin takes the concept of writer's
block and extends it to all of the "stuck" areas in our lives.

> "Because, you know: you _can't_ just turn it on and instantly be the thing you
> wish you were. It takes reflection, thought, iteration, and a personal
> commitment to facing the stuff at which you suck. And we all suck at
> something. **You** totally suck at something, and it secretly drives you nuts
> every goddamned day."

Of all these ideas for unsticking writer's block, however, I think my all time
favorite has still got to be Warren Haymen's admonition:

> "Write."

Sometimes, that's all you can do. Just write, even if all you're doing is
writing gibberish.
