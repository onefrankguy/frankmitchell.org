### Steps towards world domination ###

1. Let Google [crawl the web][], indexing pages that are powered by Moveable Type, Wordpress, (insert your blogging engine of choice here).
2. Build a spam bot using [Watir][] as a framework.
3. Let your creating run wild.

The really frightening part is that with just a little bit of intelligence such a bot could bypass every [anti-spam measure][] in existence today.
