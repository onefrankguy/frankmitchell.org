We get what we give,  
And I have been lax in my giving.  

Is it time, place, passage of life?  
I can hold on to nothing but heartache and strife.  
As the world turns around you drift further away.  
Is this what I asked for? To whom can I pray,  
To deliver me from evil, wash away all my sin.  
I'd give anything right now to start all over again.  
But we can't do that; we have come to far now.  
Words spoken at midnight, I'm unworthy of that vow.  

Watching an eggshell world crack beneath my feet,  
I slip and fall, tumbling into a pit of frustration.
