I'm pretty sure it was [Al Carlson][] who taught me how to ask questions.
Actually, I've always questioned stuff. Al just gave me a systematic framework
for doing it. Before we dug into any new area of research, we'd always ask the
same three questions. I still find myself asking them when I start a new
project. Here's what I asked when I started to [build my first HF radio][norcal-40a].

## Why am I doing this? ##

"I want to learn how a radio works."

It's important to not stop at the first answer. The first answer is usually a
gut reaction. It's technically correct, but it doesn't really tell you anything.
Sakichi Toyoda came up with this thing where you [ask "why" five times][whys] to
get at the root cause of something. Let's ask why again.

"I want to build my own radio from scratch."

That's interesting. I'm stating this project from a kit, but what I really want
to get out of it is enough understanding to be the guy who dreams up the
circuit. This isn't so much about building a radio as it is teaching myself
how to invent. Let's ask why again.

"I want a direct connection to what I'm communicating with."

There's something very immediate about pressing a key and getting a response. A
radio that sends and receives Morse code is a very tactile thing. There's no
voice operated switch. You have to touch the radio to transmit. I like that
feeling of physical control. Let's ask why again.

"I don't trust my own voice."

Most people don't like the sound of their own voice when they hear it recorded.
Mine sounds higher-pitched than I think it is, probably due to the fact that my
ears pick up on bone-conducted frequencies while the recording only picks up
on the vibrations in the air. But the crux of that response is "trust" not
"like". So let's ask why again.

"It lies."

In grade school, we did this science fair where we built a telegraph. It was
a car battery connected to a switch that fed a hand wound inductor that tapped
two bits of metal together when the magnetic field got strong enough. It worked
fine when we where goofing off with it at home. But it didn't work when we
reassembled it at the fair. When the judges came around and asked if it had
worked before, I said, "Yes".

This resulted in an argument with my friends as to whether non-repeatable
science experiments counted or not. We ended up winning third place, I think in
large part due to the fact that we could explain the science behind a telegraph,
even if we couldn't demonstrate a working model. But in the back of my mind I
attributed it to the notion that I'd lied.

I find it fascinating how my experience of my past so profoundly colors my
present. Though the scientist in me would argue this is most likely a form of
cognitive bias. Still, it's the practice of questioning that's important. We
started with a project to build a radio, and ended up with deep feelings around
a childhood memory.

"Why?" isn't the only question you can ask here. In yoga we often use "What
is true?" and "What is also true?" which tend to prompt more inward looking
responses. As [my yoga teacher][] is fond of pointing out, this is an advanced
practice, and you get better at it with practice.

## Who's done it before? ##

## When is it done? ##

## Asking isn't always the answer ##

Of course, asking questions isn't always the right approach. Creative endevors
often respond best to [jumping in with both feet][wise]. It's easy to get caught
up in analysis paralysis and hard to let go of doubt fear and worry.
