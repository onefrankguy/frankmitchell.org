Gossamer wings  
So tiny and delicate  
Paint my lips  
With rainbow scales  

Take me someplace  
Higher still  
To kiss the flowers  
And touch the wind  

Leave my mind  
In no-thingness  
While my heart resides  
In a beating chest  

Did you know  
I couldn't breath  
Anything but you  
And your gossamer wings
