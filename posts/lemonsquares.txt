### Background ###

This is a recipe from the _Mitchell Family Cookbook_ for my Aunt Linda's lemon squares. Most delicious when served with vanilla ice cream.

### Ingredients ###

* 1 cup butter
* 0.5 cups powdered sugar
* 2.66 cups flour
* 4 eggs
* 1.75 cups sugar
* 0.5 teaspoons baking powder
* 0.33 cups lemon juice

### Preparation ###

Combine butter, powdered sugar, and 2.33 cups of the flour together in the order listed. Press it into a pan, and bake at 350-375 degrees for 20 minutes. Mix the eggs, sugar, baking powder, lemon juice, and remaining flour in a blender. Blend well, then pour over the partially baked crust. Continue baking at the same temperature for 25 minutes. When it's done, cool and sprinkle with powdered sugar.
