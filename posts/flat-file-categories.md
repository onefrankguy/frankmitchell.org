Just finished reading through some of the [Design Engaged 2004][] notes that are
popping up on the web. Way too many ideas bouncing around in my head now.
Fortunately, that's part of what Elimossinary was designed to address: get it
out of your brain fast so you don't forget it.

Random bits that I want to track then:

Thomas Vander Wal's presentation, [That Syncing Feeling][]. I like the
standardized metadata for a personal infocloud. More interesting however, are
[Timo Arnall's notes][] on the categorization:
