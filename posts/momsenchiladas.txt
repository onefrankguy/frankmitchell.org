### Background ###

This is my mother's recipe for enchiladas.

### Ingredients ###

* 1 pound ground beef
* 1 cup oil
* 1 package chili seasoning mix
* 1 or 2 chopped onions
* 6 to 8 tortillas
* 2 cups shredded cheddar
* 1 or 2 cans enchilada sauce

### Preparation ###

Brown beef, add seasoning, and cook until done. Heat oil in separate skillet, and drop in hot oil to soften. Heat enchilada sauce in shallow pan and dip tortillas to coat them. Lift tortillas onto baking dish, fill with meat and onions, and fold over. Pour remaining sauce over the top and sprinkle heavily with cheese. Bake at 325 degrees until cheese is melted and bubbly.
