### Background ###

This is Mayz Leonard's recipe for one of my favorite Christmas cookies that's both easy and fun to make.

### Ingredients ###

* 1 cup shortening (or 0.5 cups shortening and 0.5 cups butter)
* 1 cup sifted powdered sugar
* 1 egg
* 0.5 teaspoons salt
* 1.5 teaspoons almond extract
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 2.5 cups flour
* red food coloring

### Preparation ###

Mix everything together (except the red food coloring) and divide the dough into two equal portions. Color one portion red. Knead the dough to mix the red food coloring in it. Use ropes of red and white dough twisted together to make candy canes. Bake on an ungreased cookie sheet at 375 degrees for 9 to 17 minutes.

### Notes ###

You can make these cookies in heart shapes as well and use them for Valentine's Day.
