### Background ###

This is a recipe I found on the internet when Sarah and I wanted meatballs with our spaghetti. The original recipe called for Italian bread crumbs, but we used Italian seasoning, since that's what we found at the store.

### Ingredients ###

* 1 pound lean ground beef
* 0.5 cups bread crumbs
* 1 package dry Italian seasoning
* 0.33 cups water (more or less)
* 0.25 cups grated Parmesan cheese
* 1 medium onion
* garlic
* salt
* pepper

### Preparation ###

Mix all ingredients together. Don't add all of the water at one time. Mixture should be moist but not so that the meatballs fall apart. Shape meatballs to desired size and place on a broiler pan. Broil until outside is slightly brown on one side and then turn and broil the other side. When finished, add to spaghetti sauce and simmer at least 20 minutes.
