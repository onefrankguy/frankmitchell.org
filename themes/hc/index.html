<h1>Hard bugs and unknown assumptions</h1>

<p>Assumptions color everything we do, and I&#39;m pretty sure you can&#39;t function
without them. Given how complex the world is, at some point you just have to go,
&ldquo;Yeah, I assume it&#39;s going to work&rdquo; and move on. But the worst assumptions, the
ones that cause you to tear your hair out or cry yourself to sleep in
frustration, are the ones you don&#39;t even know you&#39;re making.</p>

<h2>Hard bugs</h2>

<p>When it comes to programming, the hardest bugs to fix are the ones where a base
assumption gets violated. You assume something to be true, only to find out it&#39;s
false. Here&#39;s an example with a bit of Ruby I was working on the other day.</p>

<pre><code>results = []
mgram = []
characters.each do |letter|
  mgram &lt;&lt; letter
  mgram = mgram[1, size] if mgram.size &gt; size
  results &lt;&lt; mgram if mgram.size == size
end
</code></pre>

<p>Every time the loop terminated, the <code>results</code> array would be filled with strings
of letters (m-grams) that were longer than the <code>size</code> variable.  That wasn&#39;t at
all what I intended, and it drove me bonkers. I stepped through the code
checking my assumptions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Letters were being appended to the <code>mgrams</code> variable.</li>
<li>The <code>mgrams</code> variable was being trimmed to the right size.</li>
<li>M-grams were being added to the <code>results</code> array.</li>
<li>We went back to the top of the loop and continued.</li>
</ul>

<p>Which of those assumptions is wrong?</p>

<p>As it turns out, none of them. The place I&#39;d gone wrong was in assuming that
appending to an array created a copy. But it didn&#39;t; it created a reference. So
when the loop came around again and added another letter to <code>mgram</code> it also put
one onto the end of the m-gram I&#39;d just put in <code>results</code>. I fixed it by changing
<code>results &lt;&lt; mgram</code> to <code>results &lt;&lt; mgram.clone</code>.</p>

<p>This kind of thing happens all the time. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s the reason so many
programmers distrust documentation and suffer from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Invented_Here" title="Wikipedia: Not Invented Here">NIH</a>.  There are so many
layers between our ideas and what&#39;s really going on, that we have to assume
things are working correctly if we want to get anything done.</p>

<p>And when our assumptions go wrong, we&#39;re left with really hard bugs.</p>

<h3>Growing persistent assumptions</h3>

<p>It&#39;s easy to ditch assumptions you can shine a critical light on. Assumptions
you can reason about and test are easy to verify. &ldquo;Hmm&hellip; I turned on the
dishwasher and all the lights went out. I&#39;ll assume the fuse is blown.&rdquo; Easy to
think about. Easy to check. Easy to solve.</p>

<p>The assumptions that are hard to let go of are the ones you don&#39;t even know
you&#39;re holding. Such base assumptions are typically formed by your first
exposure to a new idea.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example.</p>

<p>When I first learned to program, it was with the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSL_Transformations" title="Wikipedia: XSL Transformations">XSLT</a> to transform
XML files into web pages. Though I didn&#39;t know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness%22" title="Wikipedia: Turing completeness">I was programming</a>, that first
act permanently colored my view. Even after getting a Computer Science degree
and spending years in industry, I still view programming as the art of writing
down information and the functions that transform it into a usable form.</p>

<p>This idea of programming is totally different (and often alien) to someone who
grew up programing with punch cards. For them, programing is the art of
<a href="/2010/09/small-code" title="Frank Mitchell: Bytes matter on the mobile web">optimizing for size and speed</a>. Those were the things that were most
important when they were exposed to the idea. Those are the things that are most
important now.</p>

<p>These base assumptions form without conscious thought because our brains are
wonderful pattern recognition engines. They take in new information and form a
pattern about it. Any similar information we encounter in the future is
automatically filtered through that pattern, which just reinforces it.</p>

<p>While subsequent exposures might modify the pattern, it&#39;s the first exposure
that imprints strongest. That exposure doesn&#39;t have to be for any significant
duration. An offhand comment by a friend works as well as a college lecture. The
only thing that matters is that the information is new.</p>

<h2>Continuous learning is an antidote</h2>

<p>As soon as you identify a base assumption, you have the opportunity to change
it. But how do you recognize it&#39;s there in the first place?</p>

<p>The process that works for me is to keep learning as much as I can about as many
different things as possible. I can only keep a finite amount of information in
my head. The more I learn, the more assumptions I have to challenge and let go
of in order to make room for new ideas.</p>

<p>Then I flop down on the floor, stare at the ceiling, and turn those ideas over
in my head. I go through the usual round of questions.  &ldquo;Is this true?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Do I
believe it?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;How does it fit with what I already know?&rdquo; are all good
starting points.</p>

<p>Usually somewhere in that process something will click, and I&#39;ll recognize that
I&#39;m holding onto an assumption. When that happens, I can call it out, look it
over, and decide wether to keep it or not.</p>
