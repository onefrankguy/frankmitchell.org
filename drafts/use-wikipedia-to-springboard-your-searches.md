"Siri, how does a voltage divider work?"

I'm pretty sure this is where most queries start. Make a request of your phone
and let speech-to-text translators and relevance ranking algorithms take it from
there. Like magic the answer appears. But what if it's not the right answer?
What do you do then?

## Look it up in an encyclopedia ##

When I ask [Wikipedia][] about spiders, I get an article about eight legged
arthropods with venomous fangs. When I ask Google about spiders, I get
recommendations to play Spider Solitaire. Why the difference? Wikipedia
understands that the term "spider" refers to the creature. Google understands
that I like mobile games.

The problem with asking a search engine anything, is that the response will be
tailored to what the corporation behind the engine thinks you want, rather than
what you want. But an encyclopedia is a biased collection of facts.

Starting with facts helps you move beyond Siri as your only search option. You
can break any article down to drive your search towards more general concepts or
specific answers. Read through an article once so you know what's in it, then go
back and read it again taking notes as you go. You're looking for terms, names,
and images.

## Look for general terms ##

Terms refers to any concept that's related to the article's subject.

## Look for unique names ##

## Look for images ##
