Physical products are beholden to the timetamble of the manufacturing proecess.
If I'm producing a circuit board, I have to get the design finished, tested, and
released to manufacturing if I want to meet a Christmas order. If turn around
time for production is eight weeks, that means I've got to be done months before
I plan on selling units.

Software is a lot more squishy. I can use feature flags to hide stuff and get it
into the production pipeline before it's really done. Changing the color scheme
can be as simple as updating a single file. By being able to pull off fast
iterations at the last minute, software developers have created a culture of
expectation around that rapid turnaround time.
