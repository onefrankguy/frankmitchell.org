When you're doing chip design, you spend a lot of time up front getting the
details right. Once you've burned silicon and the customer's soldered it into
their products, asking them to redo that work because you found a bug and need
to put out a new version is a risky proposition.

Yet we do this in software all the time.

The squishy nature of software, the ease with which libraries can be swapped,
code recompiled, and prototypes published, makes for a very rapid development
environment. What cost does it come at? We sacrafice stability for quick
customer feedback. We risk loalty for a chance to be first to market. And we
degenerate the label of engineer by refusing to meet professional standards.

"If it leaves your computer, it's production."

This is a personal motto. I have a moral obligation as an engineer to support
the software I ship to the best of my ability. Once I've turned it over to a
customer, once someone other than me sees it, I'm stuck with that design, that
iteration, that code.

This is not a responsibility I take lightly.

Software engineering has coded itself into a corner. Customers now expect beta
products to be as polished as released ones. They howl in rage when
functionality they depend on goes missing, even if it was broken unstable buggy
functionality. Thanks to the internet, that howling is magnified a million
times.

"You can't remove that until we replace it with something better."

Network connectivity gives us an unprecidented level of user feedback. We can
monitor which page of our websites are visited, which functions in our libraries
are called, and which buttons in our GUIs users click on. If we find things that
go unused, code that goes unexecuted, we can remove it. But if even one, one
single solitary customer makes use of a feature, even if it's only in a blue
moon, we owe it to that person to support their work. After all, we enabled that
work in the first place.

The medical community has the Hippocratic Oath, "Do no harm." The closest we
have as an engineering profession is the Order of the Engineer, which contains
the words, "...my skill caries with it the obligation to serve humanity by
making the best use of Earth's precious wealth." What is the greatest wealth of
all if not time? With every bug and broken feature that we okay to ship by
slapping a "beta" label on our software, through the justification of "Oh, it's
only being used by a few people" we push ourselves further into a horrific
maintenance cycle, sqandering not only our own time supporting and fixing broken
functionality but our customer's time as well as the strive for workarounds.

We have unlimited redos and huge amounts of flexibility when it comes to kicking
code out the door. Consequently, we produce bloated complex monstrocities.
Strive for simplicity. Make it touchstone, a foundation, a moral obligation.
Give your customer only that which works and that which you are willing to
support and maintain for the rest of your natural life.

Do not degrade your work with a beta label, but proudly show it off for what it
is, a shipped product that you're willing to back with your professional
reputation.
