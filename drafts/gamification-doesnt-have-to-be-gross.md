Gamification is one of those words that turns me off. When is see badges added
to a product in order to retain me as a customer, I feel manipulated. The sound
"eww" escapes my lips. I want to find delight in a product because of its
inherant wonderfullness. I need my desire for achievment and status to be
filled without artifical additivies. Gamification, as it's typically applied
to marketing, doesn't do that for me.

Yet games are as old as humanity. And there are contexts in which I'm entirely
comfortable with the practice of adding play to a product.

Gamification can make hard things easy. When "Take out the trash" becomes "Uh,
hot karate test" laghter results. Suddenly I'm a ninja who has to get the
garbage can out to the street corner without waking up the neighbors.
