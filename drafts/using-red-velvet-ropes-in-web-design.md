Branding is one of the stickiest parts of design. When you're designing on
a budget, it's tempting to focus on color and typography and responsive layouts,
since those are the things the books and blogs talk about. Pick a design that
resonates with your audience, and you've got a chance to turn a casual visitor
into a true fan. [Keen IO][] is an awesome example of red velvet rope branding.
Here's how they do it.

## Show off what you do ##

When you kick off your startup with three engineers, having a slick corporate
image is the last thing on your mind. You don't need a website that screams
big business. Business can't recommend you to friends, sign up for your service,
or buy your stuff. People do those things. Don't worry that you can't afford to hire
a designer. Just show of what you're good at. Put code samples on your front

## Price it like you care ##

When you've only got a six month runway, you tend to think twice as hard about
every purchase. Even things that amortize out to less than the cost of a daily
latte become line items on the budget that have to be justified. As a startup
targeting other starups, you know price is the thing your customers are going
to zero in on. How then, do you make that price worth it?

Keen IO takes a novel approach by getting you to smile about [their prices][].

* Developer - $0
* Startup - $32
* Growth - $128
* Premium - $256
* Professional - $768
* Enterprise - $2048

What do all those numbers have in common? They're all multiples of eight.
Instead of going with the usual "good, better, best" model and pricing things
at $150, $250, and $500, they picked numbers that would resonate with their
audience. Programmers are used to working with numbers like 32 and 256 and 2048
on a daily basis, so dealing with them as price points is no big deal.

If you walk into a grocery store and see a sign saying "Oranges: Two for
$3.99". Is it imediately obvious that a single orange costs $1.99? Unless you're
used to working with prices like that, it's not an intuitive thing. Picking
price points that end in 99 purposefully obfuscates the cost of stuff. By
pricing their service in multiples of eight, Keen IO's making their prices
easy for programmers to understand.

Price is something you can be super flexible with, since the monetary
difference between a number that resonates with your audience and one that
doesn't is often pretty small. You might lose $22 by pricing something at $128
instead of $150, but you'll make it back in spades by catoring to your
customer's sense of familiar. People who don't find your non-standard pricing
understandable, will automatically exclude themselves by saying, "That costs too
much." Which leaves you with just the customers you want, ones who like your
prices and can afford them.
