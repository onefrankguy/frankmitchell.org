## Show of what you do ##

## Price it like you care ##

When you've only got a six month runway, you tend to think twice as hard about
every purchase. Even things that amortize out to less than the cost of a daily
latte become line items on the budget that have to be justified. As a startup
targeting other starups, you know price is the thing your customers are going
to zero in on. How then, do you make that price worth it?

Keen IO takes a novel approach by getting you to smile about [their prices][].

* Developer - $0
* Startup - $32
* Growth - $128
* Premium - $256
* Professional - $768
* Enterprise - $2048

What do all those numbers have in common? They're powers of two. Instead of
going with the usual "good, better, best" model and pricing things at $150,
$250, and $500, they picked numbers that would resonate with their audience.
