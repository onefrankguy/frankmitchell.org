		<h3>Let&rsquo;s talk about me</h3>
		<h4>I&rsquo;m a build engineer</h4>
		<p>The first build system I ever wrote was a home grown AppleScript that pushed text files up to a web server. I used it to post lecture notes online, which resulted in other students not showing up for class. It taught me that technology can change people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
		<p>The second build system I wrote was for <a title="Professional Home Design Software by Chief Architect" href="http://chiefarchitect.com/">Chief Architect</a>.<sup>1</sup> It started out as a simple Ruby script for generating Windows installers. Three years later, it was a Visual Studio integrated, <abbr class="letterspace" title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> file generating, <abbr title="Three-Dimensional">3D</abbr> model packaging, content distribution system. It taught me that software needs to be flexible.</p>
		<h4>I ship things</h4>
		<p>The most recent thing I shipped was <a title="Download Prolix for your phone or play it online" href="http://prolix-app.com/">Prolix</a>,<sup>2</sup> a tweetable word search game for the iPhone and iPod touch. It works on Android too, and in your web browser. My wife found a rotation bug with the letters a week after it launched. It taught me that real users make the best testers.</p>
		<p>Before that, I collaborated with a graphic artist to create a <a title="Dance of Shiva Cards" href="http://nichecards.com/shop/">deck of yoga cards</a>.<sup>3</sup> It was a struggle to describe human poses and printed colors in emailed words. It taught me that good communication will get your further than anything else.</p>
		<h4>I have a philosophy</h4>
		<p>Computers can make the world a better place. We&rsquo;re not there yet. There are still too many sharp edges and clunky interfaces; not enough engineers design what they build or can build what they design.</p>
		<p>We&rsquo;ll know we&rsquo;ve gotten there when computers start showing up in kitchens and bathrooms and bedrooms. When they start fading into the background of our lives. When they stop looking and feeling like computers and start feeling like extensions of our selves.</p>
		<p>I think that&rsquo;s where litl&rsquo;s going.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="you">
		<h3>Let&rsquo;s talk about you</h3>
		<h4>You&rsquo;re an awesome company</h4>
		<p>You&rsquo;re litl. You make a <a title="litl :: overview" href="http://www.litl.com/meet-webbook/overview.htm">webbook</a> that makes <a title="litl house in the neighborhood" href="http://litlhouse.wordpress.com/">family life better</a>. You&rsquo;re working on a <a title="litl :: what&rsquo;s next" href="http://www.litl.com/workshop/whats-next.htm">web-connected <abbr title="Television">TV</abbr> product</a>. You&rsquo;re looking for a <a title="Litl&rsquo;s job post for a build engineer" href="http://careers.joelonsoftware.com/Jobs/8535">build engineer</a>. And you have a <a title="litl :: philosophy" href="http://www.litl.com/essays/philosophy.htm">philosophy</a> that makes me shout, &ldquo;Yay! Someone else gets how a computer <em>should</em> work.&rdquo;</p>
		<h4>You need an awesome engineer</h4>
		<p>You need someone who understands that deployment isn&rsquo;t just a Python script running on a build machine. That it&rsquo;s a process that has to be designed hand-in-hand with a product. Someone who&rsquo;s flexible enough to balance the needs of development, <abbr title="Quality Assurance">QA</abbr>, and customer service. An engineer who can say, &ldquo;<strong>No.</strong> We&rsquo;re not putting that in the build system,&rdquo; and then come up with a creative solution for where it should go.</p>
		<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest. Working at litl is my dream job. You&rsquo;re one of the few companies that&rsquo;s built a computer and <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> from the ground up. You&rsquo;re high profile, and you&rsquo;ve got a lot of competition. There&rsquo;s going to be huge pressure to make sure deployment gets handled right. Updates aren&rsquo;t opt-in, so one bad packet could take down every litl out there. You&rsquo;re going to need somebody who&rsquo;s <strong>creative under pressure</strong>, can <strong>communicate well</strong> and can <strong>get things done</strong>.</p>
		<h4>I&rsquo;m that guy</h4>
		<p>I spent almost as much time on this letter pushing pixels and setting type as I did editing content. I did so, because I believe the web is the future, and user experience is important. Products like the litl, that merge the web with beautiful design, are the direction computing has to go.</p>
		<p>litl&rsquo;s a company where I can learn new things. Where I can cultivate my passion for better user experiences. Where I can help craft products that are technologically rich and simple enough for my grandparents to use. It&rsquo;s a place where I can grow.</p>
		<p>I want to be a litl engineer.</p>
